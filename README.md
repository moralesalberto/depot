Depot Application
-----------------

This is a learning exercise, where I take the rails Depot application and write it with Cucumber 
features and HAML for the views. This started with just this README, but that got to be too long
so I moved the explanation to the repository's 
[wiki](https://github.com/moralesalberto/depot/wiki/02-Styling-the-Products-Listing) 
to document the journey.

Come join me for a HAML and Cucumber road trip, with Bootstrap 3 and anything else that might
seem interesting as we hit different parts of the app.

[Chapter 1 - Getting started and Products Listing Feature] (https://github.com/moralesalberto/depot/wiki/01-Getting-started-and-Products-Listing-Feature)  
<i>Setup Cucumber, write your first feature</i>

[Chapter 2 - Stylng the Products Listing](https://github.com/moralesalberto/depot/wiki/02-Styling-the-Products-Listing)  
<i>Setup the style with Bootstrap 3, and setup a seeds.rb file for viewing this on the web.</i>

[Chapter 3 - Adding New Products](https://github.com/moralesalberto/depot/wiki/03-Adding-New-Products)  
<i>Write the next feature to create products from the admin interface</i>

The next will come as I continue through the exercise...
