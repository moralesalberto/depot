Depot Application
-----------------

This is a learning exercise, where I take the rails Depot application and write it with Cucumber 
features and HAML for the views. This started with just this README, but that got to be too long
so I moved the explanation to the repository's 
[wiki](https://github.com/moralesalberto/depot/wiki/02-Styling-the-Products-Listing) 
to document the journey.

Come join me for a HAML and Cucumber road trip, with Bootstrap 3 and anything else that might
seem interesting as we hit different parts of the app.

[Chapter 1 - Getting started and Products Listing Feature] (https://github.com/moralesalberto/depot/wiki/01-Getting-started-and-Products-Listing-Feature)
